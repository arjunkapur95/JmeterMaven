## Overview ##

This is a sample project to show how we can run [JMeter][1] tests with the [JMeter Maven Plugin][2] and the [JMeter Analysis Maven Plugin][2].

It runs a [JMeter][1] test against a few URLs on www.github.com and illustrates how the maven plugin can be used to run
with different configurations.


## Usage ##

  * look in `target/jmeter/report/` for the JMeter results file
  * look in `target/reports/` for the Report generated by the JMeter Analysis Maven Plugin

## URL lists ##

Test with different URL's by changing /src/test/uris.txt

## Configuration for Jenkins ##

* Execute `mvn verify -Pperformance`
